# Connectome

## Description
Senior Design Project at Drexel University. <http://www.cci.drexel.edu/seniordesign/2016_2017/Als/Als.html>

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, causes the loss of motor skills, making it hard for people to communicate with their friends and family. Recently, technology has been created that has the ability to track brain waves and correspond them with specific actions. Using one of these projects, the Emotiv, our application will allow ALS patients to communicate through social media by just using their mind.

Connectome is a hardware-software solution that uses Unity, C# and the Emotiv Epoc to allow patients with ALS and other disabilitating disorders to use Twitter to communicate with their loved ones.


## How to get the Project Running
First, import the project Connectome-csharp into visual studio. Rebuild all of the projects in the solution. Next, import the project Connectome-unity into visual studio. Rebuild all of the projects in the solution as well. Finally, open the connectome-unity project in Unity, and run the scenes that you wish.
