<P>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used to 
create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML 
documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for 
representing information from a wide range of applications. This specification 
defines HTML version 3.2. HTML 3.2 aims to capture recommended practice as of 
early '96 and as such to be used as a replacement for HTML 2.0 (<A 
href="#refs">RFC 
1866</A>).

<H2><A name=intro>Introduction to HTML 3.2</A></H2>
<P>HTML 3.2 is W3C's specification for HTML, developed in early `96 together 
with vendors including IBM, Microsoft, Netscape Communications Corporation, 
Novell, SoftQuad, Spyglass, and Sun Microsystems. HTML 3.2 adds widely deployed 
features such as tables, applets and text flow around images, while providing 
full backwards compatibility with the existing standard HTML 2.0. 
<P>W3C is continuing to work with vendors on extensions for accessibility 
features, multimedia objects, scripting, style sheets, layout, forms, math and 
internationalization. W3C plans on incorporating this work in further versions 
of HTML. 
<H3><A name=sgml>HTML as an SGML Application</A></H3>
<P>HTML 3.2 is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 
-- Standard Generalized Markup Language. As an SGML application, the syntax of 
conforming HTML 3.2 documents is defined by the combination of the <A 
href="#sgmldecl">SGML 
declaration</A> and the <A 
href="#dtd">document 
type definition</A> (DTD). This specification defines the intended 
interpretation of HTML 3.2 elements, and places further constraints on the 
permitted syntax which are otherwise inexpressible in the DTD. 
<P>The SGML rules for record boundaries are tricky. In particular, a record end 
immediately following a start tag should be discarded. For example: <PRE>&lt;P&gt;
Text</PRE>
<P>is equivalent to:</P><PRE>&lt;P&gt;Text</PRE>
<P>Similarly, a record end immediately preceding an end tag should be discarded. 
For example: <PRE>Text
&lt;/P&gt;</PRE>
<P>is equivalent to: </P><PRE>Text&lt;/P&gt;</PRE>
<P>Except within literal text (e.g. the <SAMP>PRE</SAMP> element), HTML treats 
contiguous sequences of white space characters as being equivalent to a single 
space character (ASCII decimal 32). These rules allow authors considerable 
flexibility when editing the marked-up text directly. Note that future revisions 
to HTML may allow for the interpretation of the horizontal tab character (ASCII 
decimal 9) with respect to a tab rule defined by an associated style sheet. 
<P>SGML entities in PCDATA content or in CDATA attributes are expanded by the 
parser, e.g. <SAMP>&amp;#233;</SAMP> is expanded to the ISO Latin-1 character 
decimal 233 (a lower case letter e with an acute accent). This could also have 
been written as a named character entity, e.g. <SAMP>&amp;eacute;</SAMP>. The 
&amp; character can be included in its own right using the named character 
entity <SAMP>&amp;amp;</SAMP>. 
<P>HTML allows CDATA attributes to be unquoted provided the attribute value 
contains only letters (a to z and A to Z), digits (0 to 9), hyphens (ASCII 
decimal 45) or, periods (ASCII decimal 46). Attribute values can be quoted using 
double or single quote marks (ASCII decimal 34 and 39 respectively). Single 
quote marks can be included within the attribute value when the value is 
delimited by double quote marks, and vice versa. 
<P>Note that some user agents require attribute minimisation for the following 
attributes: <SAMP>COMPACT</SAMP>, <SAMP>ISMAP</SAMP>, <SAMP>CHECKED</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>NOWRAP</SAMP>, <SAMP>NOSHADE</SAMP> and <SAMP>NOHREF</SAMP>. These user 
agents don't accept syntax such as <SAMP>COMPACT=COMPACT</SAMP> or 
<SAMP>ISMAP=ISMAP</SAMP> although this is legitimate according to the HTML 3.2 
DTD. 
<P>The SGML declaration and the DTD for use with HTML 3.2 are given in 
appendices. Further guidelines for parsing HTML are given in <A 
href="#refs">WD-html-lex</A>.

<H3><A name=html>The Structure of HTML documents</A></H3>
<P>HTML 3.2 Documents start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration followed by an 
HTML element containing a <A 
href="#head"><SAMP>HEAD</SAMP></A> 
and then a <A 
href="#body"><SAMP>BODY</SAMP></A> 
element: <PRE>  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;
  &lt;HTML&gt;
  &lt;HEAD&gt;
  &lt;TITLE&gt;A study of population dynamics&lt;/TITLE&gt;
  <I>... other head elements</I>
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;
  &lt;BODY&gt;
  <I>... document body</I>
  &lt;/BODY&gt;
  &lt;/HTML&gt;</PRE>
<P>In practice, the <SAMP>HTML</SAMP>, <A 
href="#head"><SAMP>HEAD</SAMP></A> 
and <A 
href="#body"><SAMP>BODY</SAMP></A> 
start and end tags can be omitted from the markup as these can be inferred in 
all cases by parsers conforming to the <A 
href="#dtd">HTML 
3.2 DTD</A>. 
<P>Every conforming HTML 3.2 document <B>must</B> start with the 
<SAMP>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</SAMP> declaration that is needed to distinguish HTML 3.2 
documents from other versions of HTML. The HTML specification is not concerned 
with storage entities. As a result, it is not required that the document type 
declaration reside in the same storage entity (i.e. file). A Web site may choose 
to dynamically prepend HTML files with the document type declaration if it is 
known that all such HTML files conform to the HTML 3.2 specification. 
<P>Every HTML 3.2 document must also include the descriptive title element. A 
minimal HTML 3.2 document thus looks like: <PRE>  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;
  &lt;TITLE&gt;A study of population dynamics&lt;/TITLE&gt;</PRE>
<P><I>Note: the word "Final" replaces "Draft" now that the HTML 3.2 
specification has been ratified by the W3C member organizations.</I> 
<HR/>

<H2><A name=head>The HEAD element</A></H2>
<P>This contains the document head, but you can always omit both the start and 
end tags for <SAMP>HEAD</SAMP>. The contents of the document head is an 
unordered collection of the following elements: 
<UL>
  <LI><A 
  href="#title">The 
  TITLE element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#script">The 
  STYLE element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#script">The 
  SCRIPT element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#isindex">The 
  ISINDEX element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#base">The 
  BASE element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#meta">The 
  META element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#link">The 
  LINK element</A> </LI></UL><PRE>&lt;!ENTITY % head.content "TITLE &amp; ISINDEX? &amp; BASE?"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % head.misc "SCRIPT|STYLE|META|LINK"&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT HEAD O O  (%head.content) +(%head.misc)&gt;</PRE>
<P>The %head.misc entity is used to allow the associated elements to occur 
multiple times at arbitrary positions within the HEAD. The following elements 
can be part of the document head: 
<DL>
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#title">TITLE</A></B> 
  defines the document title, and is always needed. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#isindex">ISINDEX</A></B> 
  for simple keyword searches, see <SAMP>PROMPT</SAMP> attribute. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#base">BASE</A></B> 
  defines base URL for resolving relative URLs. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#script">SCRIPT</A></B> 
  reserved for future use with scripting languages. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#style">STYLE</A></B> 
  reserved for future use with style sheets. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#meta">META</A></B> 
  used to supply meta info as name/value pairs. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#link">LINK</A></B> 
  used to define relationships with other documents. </DT></DL>
<P><SAMP>TITLE</SAMP>, <SAMP>SCRIPT</SAMP> and <SAMP>STYLE</SAMP> are containers 
and require both start and end tags. The other elements are not containers so 
that end tags are forbidden. Note that conforming browsers won't render the 
contents of <SAMP>SCRIPT</SAMP> and <SAMP>STYLE</SAMP> elements. 
<H3><A name=title>TITLE</A></H3><PRE>&lt;!ELEMENT TITLE - -  (#PCDATA)* -(%head.misc)&gt;</PRE>
<P>Every HTML 3.2 document <B>must</B> have exactly one <SAMP>TITLE</SAMP> 
element in the document's <SAMP>HEAD</SAMP>. It provides an advisory title which 
can be displayed in a user agent's window caption etc. The content model is 
PCDATA. As a result, character entities can be used for accented characters and 
to escape special characters such as &amp; and &lt;. Markup is not permitted in 
the content of a <SAMP>TITLE</SAMP> element. 
<P>Example TITLE element: <PRE>    &lt;TITLE&gt;A study of population dynamics&lt;/TITLE&gt;</PRE>
<H3><A name=style>STYLE</A> and <A name=script>SCRIPT</A></H3><PRE>&lt;!ELEMENT STYLE  - - CDATA -- placeholder for style info --&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT SCRIPT - - CDATA -- placeholder for script statements --&gt;
</PRE>
